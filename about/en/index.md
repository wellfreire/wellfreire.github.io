#<a name="about_me"></a>About Me

Hi! I'm **Wellington Freire**, a software developer based at Sao Paulo, Brazil. I work professionally with development since the beginning of 2012, when I decided to completely switch my professional career to do the thing I really love to do.

Currently, I'm very focused on evolving my skills in design and software architecture, mainly by going deep into **Domain-Driven Design** -- and the plethora of good practices and tools arround it.

Beyond that, my interests on software development go through a range of other topics, with special highlight for **object-oriented programming**, **best practices** and **programming languages**.

#<a name="about_blog"></a>About This Blog

This *web log* is intended (as its title hints) to be a web-based archive for all sort of texts and notes about any subject amongst my interests. This way, I can simply register some unstructered note as well as a formated post or article. However, I do not intend to be innovative and highly productive with contents and frequent fresh new posts. Primarily, this is just a place for annotating and archiving some ideas and outcomes of my studies.

###Editable Posts

When reading [William Durand](http://williamdurand.fr/){:target="_blank"}'s blog I liked a lot of the editing feature he has made available for blog posts, simply by making a pull request -- since the blog is a GitHub public repository. Thus, as an Open Source enthusiast I decided to replicate this idea here at my blog. Therefore, feel free to make a PR and edit this blog's posts whenever you find it fair.
