#<a name="about_me"></a>About Me

I'm **Well**[ington] **Freire**, a software developer based at Sao Paulo, Brazil, currently working at [**Tricae**](http://www.tricae.com.br){:target="_blank"}, a [Rocket Internet](https://www.rocket-internet.com){:target="_blank"} e-commerce company.

###Developer

I have no problems with the *programmer* title, but I like more being a *developer* since, in my opinion, it better translates the fact that we are not just *code writers*.

I work professionally with development since the beginning of 2012, when I finally decided to completely switch my professional career to do the thing I really loves to do.

Currently, I'm very focused on evolving my skills in design and software architecture, mainly by going deep into [**Domain-Driven Design**](/en/ddd){:target="_blank"} -- and the plethora of good practices and tools arround it.

Beyond that, my interests on software development go through a range of other topics, with special highlight for [**object-oriented programming**](/en/oop){:target="_blank"}, [**best practices**](/en/best-practices){:target="_blank"}, [**REST**](/en/rest){:target="_blank"} and other [**programming languages**](/en/programming-languages){:target="_blank"}.

At *Tricae*, my current main job, I am essencially a full-stack developer working beside the rest of the team for mantaining and developing new features for our e-commerce application.

###Sao Paulo, Brazil

I am born and raised at [Sao Paulo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo){:target="_blank"}, the biggest Brazilian metropolis and one of the Worldâ€™s top ten. 

Living here is kind of amazing and terrible at same time, as might be in wherever other big city in the world. So, as many (or maybe all) Sao Paulo's citizens I have such love and hate feelings for this city, but proud of belonging to and living in here.

#<a name="about_blog"></a>About This Blog

This *web log* is intended (as its title hints) to be a web-based archive for all sort of texts and notes about any subject amongst my interests. I always had such a difficult on keeping together my annotations, writing thoughts, favorite links and these kind of stuff that now and then I whish I could more easily find for consulting again or even sharing with other people. So, I realized that this could be accomplished by putting the archive and blog concepts together.

This way, I can simply register some unstructered note as well as a formated post or article. However, I do not intend to be innovative and highly productive with contents and frequent fresh new posts. Primarily, this is just a place for annotating and archiving some ideas and outcomes of my studies. However, if this material could help someone on learning something, sure I will be very glad.

###Editable Posts

When reading [William Durand](http://williamdurand.fr/){:target="_blank"}'s blog I liked a lot of the editing feature he has made available for blog posts, simply by making a pull request -- since the blog is a GitHub public repository. Thus, as an Open Source enthusiast I decided to replicate this idea here at my blog. Therefore, feel free to make a PR and edit this blog's posts whenever you find it fair.
