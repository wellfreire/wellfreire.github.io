#<a name="about_me"></a>About Me

Hi, I'm **Well**[ington] **Freire**, currently a 29-year-old Web Developer based at Sao Paulo, Brazil, working at [**Tricae**](http://www.tricae.com.br){:target="_blank"}, a [Rocket Internet](https://www.rocket-internet.com){:target="_blank"} e-commerce company.

###Web developer

Working professionally with web development since the end of 2011, my first and current main programming language is **PHP**, which has gracefully opened the IT doors for my first job in this area -- when I finally decided to completely switch my professional carreer[^1].

Currently, I'm very focused on evolving my skills in design and software architecture, mainly by going deep into [**Domain Driven Design**](http://dddcommunity.org/learning-ddd/what_is_ddd/){:target="_blank"} -- and the plethora of design patterns arround it. Since I heard about DDD for the first time and started studying about it I have understood how valuable this approach is for software development. Hence, DDD undoubtly deserves more attention in order to be more widely adopted than it has been, considering the Brazilian PHP community in particular -- where the subject is still barely discussed (at least in a seriously manner).

Beyond that, my interests on software development go through a range of other topics, specially:

- **Object Oriented Design**: Base of most really good and sustainable enterprise software, OOD is mandatory when a developer enumerates topics of interest. Unlike what some unadvised developer could think, OO study should never be taken as finished at any time. Moreover, in order to take DDD for serious[^2], refined skills on OOD are imperative.

- **Best Practices**: I really appreciate the study and application of best practices for developing. It's kind of a cliche repeating about that, but is for sure a cliche that is worth being echoed. In a day-to-day routine is quite easy to forget about some good guidelines. Therefore, trying to keep this flame alive is such a challenge, mainly when working within a team -- that I believe it's the reality of the majority of us. Thus, I really think this is a topic that deserves highlight as a study area, even seeming so obvious.

- **REST**: Although this is one of the biggest buzz words in the last years among developers, IMHO REST is a topic that deserves as much buzzing as necessary in order to achieve the attention it needs to. I really believe that this is more than a fashion theme and should be faced as first-class subject for anyone working with web development.

- **Other languages**: I have already learned a bit on Java (mainly applied for Android) and Ruby (with Rails 3), besides a little bit on C (as part of university curriculum) and C++ (more recent on an attempt for not being completely analphabet on it). But more recently -- once PHP already serves me very well for my prime working platform, the Web --, I'm very interested on learning another completely different programming language, inclusive by changing from the comfort zone of the widespread OO paradigm and going into a completly new one. As part of this shifting interest the functional paradigm has been the main focus, where I'm trying to grasp some general concepts and elect a language for going deeper (very soon I wanna post something about it).

###At Tricae

At Tricae, my current main job, I started focused on developing an API on top of our front-end stack, which has gone to be responsible for serving the mobile stores on both Android and iOS apps. As this project has finished I joined again the rest of the team for mantaining and developing new features for our e-commerce application.

###Sao Paulo, Brazil

I am born and raised at [Sao Paulo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo){:target="_blank"}, the biggest Brazilian metropolis and one of the Worldâ€™s top ten. 

Living here is kind of amazing and terrible at same time, as might be in wherever other big city in the world. So, as many (or maybe all) Sao Paulo's citizens I have such love and hate feelings for this city, but proud of belonging to and living in here, despite of whatever problems one could raise.

#<a name="about_blog"></a>About This Blog

If you only passed the eyes through the paragraphs above I'm sure you realized what this blog is about. Yep! This *web log* is intended (as its title hints) to be a web-based archive for all sort of subjects on programming.

However, I do not intend to be innovative and high productive on contents and fresh new posts. Primarily, as hinted also by the highlighted term "web log", I just wanted a place for annotating and archiving some ideas and outcomes of my studies. If this material can help some people on learning something, or even being bootstrapped about some subject, I will be very glad.

###Editable Posts

When reading [William Durand](http://williamdurand.fr/){:target="_blank"}'s blog I liked a lot of the editing feature he has made available for blog posts, simply by making a pull request -- since the blog is a GitHub public repository. Thus, as an Open Source enthusiast I decided to replicate this idea here at my blog. Therefore, feel free to make a PR and edit this blog's posts whenever you find it fair.
