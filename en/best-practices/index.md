I really appreciate the study and application of best practices for developing. It's kind of a cliche repeating about that, but is for sure a cliche that is worth being echoed. In a day-to-day routine is quite easy to forget about some good guidelines and try to keep this flame alight is such a challenge. Thus, I really think this is a topic that deserves highlight as a study area, even seeming so obvious.
