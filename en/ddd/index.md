Since I heard about DDD for the first time and started studying about it I have understood how valuable this approach is for software development. Reading the famous Eric Evans' [blue](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321125215/domainlanguag-20){:target="_blank"} book and the Vaughn Vernon's [red](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321834577){:target="_blank"} one is, for me, like reading such that obvious things that we need someone to tell us so we can realize that. The main of these obvious things is the natural path that DDD follows for building more complex applications, where we need strategies and tactics more well defined in order to not only reach the application target, but do this in a sustainable way.
