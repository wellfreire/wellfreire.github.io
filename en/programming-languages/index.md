A good programmer should not be made of a single language. Even if you are more fluent in a language that you like more and prefer to work with, different problems may require different solutions. And different solutions for a software, several times, come along with the use of different programming languages. When I say *different* here I do not mean it just in a fashion manner. Programming languages, hopefully, do not only differ in syntax or writing structure, but frequently they differ by better supporting some aspect that is just what you need to build a better application.
